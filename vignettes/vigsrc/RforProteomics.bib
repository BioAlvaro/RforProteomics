	peptides are indistinguishable in MS, but exhibit intense low-mass
	MS/MS signature ions that support quantitation. In this study, we
	have examined the global protein expression of a wild-type yeast
	strain and the isogenic upf1Delta and xrn1Delta mutant strains that
	are defective in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and the general
	5’ to 3’ decay pathways, respectively. We also demonstrate the use
	of 4-fold multiplexing to enable relative protein measurements simultaneously
	with determination of absolute levels of a target protein using synthetic
	isobaric peptide standards. We find that inactivation of Upf1p and
	Xrn1p causes common as well as unique effects on protein expression.},

	Here we report that PAI values obtained at different concentrations
	of serum albumin show a linear relationship with the logarithm of
	protein concentration in LC-MS/MS experiments. This was also the
	case for 46 proteins in a mouse whole cell lysate. For absolute quantitation,
	PAI was converted to exponentially modified PAI (emPAI), equal to
	10PAI minus one, which is proportional to protein content in a protein
	mixture. For the 46 proteins in the whole lysate, the deviation percentages
	of the emPAI-based abundances from the actual values were within
	63\% on average, similar or better than determination of abundance
	by protein staining. emPAI was applied to comprehensive protein expression
	analysis and to a comparison study between gene and protein expression
	in a human cancer cell line, HCT116. The values of emPAI are easily
	calculated and add important quantitation information to proteomic
	experiments; therefore we suggest that they should be reported in
	large scale proteomic identification projects.},
