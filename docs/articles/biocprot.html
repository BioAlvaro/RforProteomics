      <p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
      <p>The Bioconductor project has been focused on genomics since its very beginning. Since 2011, the proteomics community is showing growing interest in the project. To demonstrate this, I report on the numbers of package, their interdependencies and their downloads to highlight the interest of both developers (number of packages and their dependencies) and users (number of downloads).</p>

<p>The <em><a href="https://github.com/lgatto/biocpkgs">biocpkgs</a></em> allows to retrieve the download data for any Bioconductor package. The packages we are interested in are those that are tagged with the <code>Proteomics</code> <em>biocView</em>. This list of packages can be obtained with the <code><a href="../reference/proteomicsPackages.html">proteomicsPackages()</a></code> function from the <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/RforProteomics">RforProteomics</a></em> package.</p>
<p>Let’s start by fetching the relevant packages:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(<span class="st">"RforProteomics"</span>)

<pre><code>## [1] "ASEB"       "bioassayR"  "biobroom"   "BioNetStat" "biosigner" 
## [6] "BRAIN"</code></pre>
<p>There are currently 105 proteomics packages in Bioconductor version 3.7.</p>
<p>We can now retrieve their download statistics. We will download the data by year and by month.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(<span class="st">"biocpkgs"</span>)

<p>The download data are provided as <code>tibbles</code>. There are respectively 6912 monthly and 576 yearly data points for the 104 packages. The download data range from 2009-01-01 to 2018-12-01.</p>
<p>As a final pre-processing step, all dates with zero downloads, which correspond to month were data wasn’t (during the month preceding package acceptance) or hasn’t yet (from this month to the end of the year) collected.</p>

</div>
<p>The figure above shows that in 2011 and in the years thereafter, the Bioconductor project has accepted a growing number of proteomics packages. Since 2009, there were 14, 15, 22, 32, 53, 69, 82, 89, 96 and 104 packages, corresponding to 1, 7, 10, 21, 16, 13, 7, 7 and 8 new packages per year.</p>
<p>While several of these packages have been produced by the same developers<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, these figures indicate an increased interest in computational proteomics community.</p>

<div id="number-of-downloads" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">

<p>Let’s start by looking at the total yearly number of downloads (figure below). The total number of yearly downloads shows a confincing increase since 2011.</p>

<p>When looking at individual packages however (below), the trend seems to hold for most packages, which show a slight but consistent upwards trend.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(pyearly, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> Date, <span class="dt">y =</span> Nb_of_distinct_IPs, <span class="dt">group =</span> package)) <span class="op">+</span>

</div>
<p>The very high number of download in 2013 and 2014 for one package (it is the <em><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/mzR">mzR</a></em>, see below) are most likely an artefact. Let set these to 5000 and 7500, corresponding to a linear from 2012 to 2015.</p>
<p>The next figure is interactive and hovering above the points highlights the package name, and the exact number of unique downloads.</p>

<p>mzR provides a unified API to the common file formats and parsers available for mass spectrometry data. It comes with a wrapper for the ISB random access parser for mass spectrometry mzXML, mzData and mzML files. The package contains the original code written by the ISB, and a subset of the proteowizard library for mzML and mzIdentML. The netCDF reading code has previously been used in XCMS.</p>

<p>Pathview is a tool set for pathway based data integration and visualization. It maps and renders a wide variety of biological data on relevant pathway graphs. All users need is to supply their data and specify the target pathway. Pathview automatically downloads the pathway graph data, parses the data file, maps user data to the pathway, and render pathway graph with the mapped data. In addition, Pathview also seamlessly integrates with pathway and gene set (enrichment) analysis tools for large-scale and fully automated analysis.</p>
