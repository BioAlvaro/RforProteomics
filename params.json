The latter document is called the package vignette, and can be accessed once the package is installed (see below). Alternatively, the vignette can be downloaded alternatively as a pdf file [here](http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/RforProteomics/RforProteomics.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","name":"R for Proteomics"}
