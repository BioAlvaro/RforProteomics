The latter document is called the package vignette, and can be accessed once the package is installed (see below) with the `RforProteomics()` function. Alternatively, the vignette can be downloaded as a pdf file [here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/RforProteomics/inst/doc/RforProteomics.pdf). \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe package is now available in [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/RforProteomics.html) version 2.12. To install the package, start `R` (currently devel version only) and enter:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nsource(\"http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\nbiocLite(\"RforProteomics\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of writing, Bioc 2.12 is the development branch, which require the development verion of `R` to install packages using `biocLite'. If you have an earlier version of `R` (`R-2.15.2`, the latest stable verions is recommended), start by installing the package dependencies as shown below. \r\n\r\n```r\r\ndeps <- c('R.utils', 'Biobase', 'mzR', 'MSnbase', \r\n          'xcms', 'msdata', 'isobar', 'MALDIquant', \r\n          'readBrukerFlexData', 'synapter', 'synapterdata', \r\n          'IPPD', 'Rdisop', 'OrgMassSpecR', 'BRAIN', \r\n          'rols', 'hpar', 'GO.db', 'org.Hs.eg.db', \r\n          'biomaRt', 'RColorBrewer', 'ggplot2', 'reshape2', \r\n          'knitr')\r\nsource(\"http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/src/installPackages.R\")\r\ninstallPackages(deps)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDownload the appropriate package from the [Bioconductor landing page](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/RforProteomics.html) and install manually using `install.packages(..., repos = \"NULL\")` or the GUI front-end of your favourite R interface.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, the package with loaded with\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(\"RforProteomics\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\nTo obtain help or additional information about the `RforProteomics` package, please contact [me](http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/).
