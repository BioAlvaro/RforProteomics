{"name":"R for Proteomics","tagline":"Package accompanying the 'R for Proteomics' publication","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nThe `RforProteomics` package distributes and extends the use-cases\r\ndescribed in the _Using `R` and Bioconductor for proteomics data\r\nanalysis_ manuscript\r\n([pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23692960) and\r\n[pre-print](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6559)).  The package illustrates\r\nhow `R` and a selection of dedicated packages that can be used to\r\naccess mass-spectrometry proteomics data, manipulate and visualise it,\r\nhow to process label-free and labelled quantitative data and how to\r\nanalyse the quantitation data.\r\n\r\nThe package will be updated beyond the content of the manuscript to\r\nkeep up-to-date with progress in the area.  The\r\n[github page](https://github.com/lgatto/RforProteomics) can be used to\r\nedit the wiki and file new issues related to the package itself of\r\ngeneral needed for proteomics that should be addressed in `R`.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if this work could stimulate a wider participation\r\nto use `R` and develop `R` packages for proteomics and promote\r\ninteraction between computational biologists working in the field of\r\nproteomics, in particular by facilitating interoperability between\r\ntheir software.  The\r\n[rbioc-sig-proteomics](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rbioc-sig-proteomics)\r\ngroup has tentatively been set up to provide an question and\r\ndiscussion forum for interested parties. Do not hesitate to\r\n[get in touch](http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/) for\r\nquestions, comments or further suggestions.\r\n\r\n## Data and vignette\r\n\r\nThe package also distributes a set of function to access data from the\r\n[ProteomeXchange](http://www.proteomexchange.org/)\r\n[`PXD000001`](http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD000001)\r\ndata, used in several examples, as well as a detailed document\r\ncontaining the exact code to reproduce all the analyses presented in\r\nthe manuscript as well as other application examples. The latter\r\ndocument is called the package vignette, and can be accessed once the\r\npackage is installed (see below) with the `RforProteomics()`\r\nfunction. Alternatively, the vignette can be downloaded as a pdf file\r\n[here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/vignettes/RforProteomics/inst/doc/RforProteomics.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe package is now available in\r\n[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/RforProteomics.html)\r\nversion 2.13. To install the package and its documentation, start `R`\r\n(>= `3.0.0` required) and type:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nsource(\"http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\nbiocLite(\"RforProteomics\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install all dependencies (78 packages, including `RforProteomics`)\r\nand reproduce the code in the vignette, replace the last line in the\r\ncode chunk above with:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nbiocLite(\"RforProteomics\", dependencies = TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\nTo obtain help or additional information about the `RforProteomics`\r\npackage, please contact\r\n[me](http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/). For help about the\r\npackages presented in the vignette or manuscript, please refer to the\r\n[R mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help),\r\n[Bioconductor mailing list](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/mailing-list/#bioconductor)\r\n(if the package is in Bioconductor) and/or the respective package\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nFor general resources about `R`, see the corresponding section in the\r\nvignettes and the\r\n[TeachingMaterial](https://github.com/lgatto/TeachingMaterial)\r\nrepository.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
