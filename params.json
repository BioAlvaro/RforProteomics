The latter document is called the package vignette, and can be accessed once the package is installed (see below) with the `RforProteomics()` function. Alternatively, the vignette can be downloaded alternatively as a pdf file [here](http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/RforProteomics/RforProteomics.pdf). \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nSince the package is not in Bioconductor, a installation script that will install unmet dependencies and `RforProteomics` automatically is available. From R, type \r\n\r\n```r\r\nsourc(\"http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/RforProteomics/installR4P.R\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nand load the package with \r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(\"RforProteomics\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\nTo obtain help or additional information about the `RforProteomics` package, please contact [me](http://proteome.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/lgatto/). For help about the packages presented in the vignette or manuscript, please refer to the [R mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help), [Biodonductor mailing list](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/mailing-list/#bioconductor) (if the package is in Bioconductor) and/or the respective package authors. \r\n","google":""}
